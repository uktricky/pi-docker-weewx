# pi-docker-weewx
WeeWx Docker Setup for running on Raspberry Pi with a GW1000

Taken from idea by https://github.com/tomdotorg/docker-weewx

This is setup to:
install weewx 5.1, using a GW1000 station type on hardcoded IP address / port

To Do:
Move database to use MariaDB for ease
Move skin to use my modified version of https://github.com/neoground/neowx-material
